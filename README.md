# AR Poster

During one week multitouch interaction workshop with Nuno Correia at Aalto Media Lab I experimented with augmented reality posters.

I ended up using Unity 3D with Vuforia plugin and iOS. Using Vuforia was really straight forward and effective.

For casting shadows on a transparent plane I used [ShadowDrawer shader by Keijiro Takahashi](https://github.com/keijiro/ShadowDrawer).
